Wrong model
	Plain old javascipt models
	And then we create a change name in the controller

	Angular 1 and 2 example

	Is it a ERB?
	Or is it a class diagram? (you also have behaviours)

	It does not mimic the real world
	and it also is not dry (because you have code in multiple controllers)
	or you behaviour is accross the app (if you are using services)

Model should have state and behaviour

	Validation and behaviours should also be in the model
	Angular 2 -> Now we can also share model with the server

Converting

	Example before and after
	Followed by a repository

Show his example but also make a DDD example
