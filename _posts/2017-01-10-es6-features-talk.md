Hi all,

I gave a talk at [SKY - NOW TV](http://www.nowtv.com/) in the beginning of 2016 explaining the [ES6](http://benmccormick.org/2015/09/14/es5-es6-es2016-es-next-whats-going-on-with-javascript-versioning/) features that I think are the most amazing ones.
The slides bellow are very self explanatory and filled with code examples. 
Feel free to use it on your company! :)

#### ES6 resources

I made this compilation after reading the book [Understanding ECMAScript 6](https://leanpub.com/understandinges6/read).
This book is amazing, it's very easy to read and goes very deep at the same time.
The examples are great and it's free!

Have fun! If you are not on the ES6 bandwagon you are missing out big time!

__Cheers :)__
