Hi all,

I gave a talk at [Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/) explaining why [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) and [TypeScript](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) might be the next cool kid on the block and how to get started.
I made this post to share the resources I mentioned during the presentation that were not already on the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/rafaelglanzner/introduction-to-angular-2-54854095).

Visit [this github repo](https://github.com/rafaelaudy/angular-2-heroes) for the simple app and [this one](https://github.com/rafaelaudy/angular-2-heroes-step-2) for the slightly more complex one. I added instructions on how to run them in the readme files.

You can check out the full talk bellow if you are interested.

__I'll add the video here as soon as it is available :)__

#### Angular Connect Keynote
This presentation was great, it is a must watch. It gives an overview of the current state of Angular 1 and 2, the objectives of Angular 2 and much more.
Also, a guy from the Meteor framework goes on stage to show a benchmark comparing Angular 2 to other frameworks.
