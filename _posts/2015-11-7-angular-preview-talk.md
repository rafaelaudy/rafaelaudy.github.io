Hi all,

I presented the talk bellow at [Valtech]() to I explain why [Angular 2]() and [TypeScrip]() might be the next cool kid on the block and how to get started. 
I made this post so I could share all the resources that I mentioned during the presentation.

__I'll add the video here as soon as it is available :)__

Here are the [slides]() for the presentation, there are some links there as well.

#### Angular Connect Keynote
This presentation was great, it is a must watch. It talks about the current state of Angular 1 and 2, the objectives of Angular 2 and much more.
Also the guy from the Meteor framework goes on the stage to show a benchmarking comparing Angular 2 to other frameworks.
