Hi all,

I gave a talk at [Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/) explaining why [Angular 2](https://angular.io/) and [TypeScrip](http://www.typescriptlang.org/) might be the next cool kid on the block and how to get started. 
You can check out the full talk bellow and on this post I'll share the resources that I mentioned during the presentation that are not already on the [slides](http://www.slideshare.net/rafaelglanzner/introduction-to-angular-2-54854095).

__I'll add the video here as soon as it is available :)__

Visit [this github repo](https://github.com/rafaelaudy/angular-2-heroes) for the simple app and [this one](https://github.com/rafaelaudy/angular-2-heroes-step-2) for the slightly more complex one. I added instructions on how to run them in the readme files.

#### Angular Connect Keynote
This presentation was great, it is a must watch. It gives an overview of the current state of Angular 1 and 2, the objectives of Angular 2 and much more.
Also, a guy from the Meteor framework goes on stage to show a benchmarking comparing Angular 2 to other frameworks.
