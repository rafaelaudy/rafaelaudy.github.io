My name is Rafael Audy Glanzner and I am a happy Brazilian, a traveller aficionado, gamer and geek. :)

I am passionate about the art of building quality software, especially when I am involved in those big, shiny and sexy web projects!  <br>
I firmly believe in the values behind the agile methodologies, specially the continuous improvement part of it. <br>
I try to apply this concept everywhere, not only on the projects that I work, but also on my personal life.

In the last year I have been studiyng and working with the MEAN stack. <br>
I also have 10+ years of experience with the .NET stack and I am currently working with it in a "wanna be startup" pet project!
