My name is Rafael Audy Glanzner and I am a happy Brazilian, traveller aficionado, gamer and geek. :)
I am currently working at [Valtech](https://www.valtech.com/) in different web projects as a senior consultant.

I am passionate about the art of building quality software, especially when I am involved in those big, shiny and sexy web projects! I firmly believe in the values behind the agile methodologies, specially the continuous improvement part of it.
Going to conferences, reading books, maintaining a blog and doing a masters are examples of how I try to apply continuous improovement to my craft and personal life.

In the last year I have been studiyng and working with the MEAN stack. I also have 10+ years of experience with the .NET stack and I am currently working with it in a "wanna be startup" pet project!
